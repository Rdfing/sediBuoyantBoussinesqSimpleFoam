# sediBuoyantBoussinesqSimpleFoam
Steady-state solver for sedimentation, buoyant, turbulent flow of incompressible fluids.

Developed based on the native OpenFOAM solver of buoyantBoussinesqSimpleFoam and equilibrium-Euler appraoch

# Notes

For complex problem, this solver is struggling with convergence. Instead, it is recommanded to run the transient solver to steady state.
